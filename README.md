This is a Team reseach based on World University Ranking 2023.

## Comparison of Overall Scores Between US and UK Universities

### **1. Overview**

This analysis compares the **Overall Score** of universities in the United States and the United Kingdom to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups. The study uses descriptive statistics, Welch’s t-test, and Cohen’s *d* effect size.

## **2. Data Summary**

| Statistic    | United States | United Kingdom |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| **N**        | 57            | 19             |
| **Mean**     | 71.10         | 68.63          |
| **Median**   | 67.80         | 60.80          |
| **SD**       | 13.49         | 14.50          |
| **Min**      | 54.60         | 54.40          |
| **Max**      | 95.20         | 96.40          |
| **Q1 (25%)** | 58.30         | 58.45          |
| **Q3 (75%)** | 82.70         | 78.45          |

## **3. Hypotheses**

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):**
(\mu_{\text{US}} = \mu_{\text{UK}})
There is **no difference** in mean Overall Score between US and UK universities.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**
(\mu_{\text{US}} \neq \mu_{\text{UK}})
There **is a significant difference** in mean Overall Score between the two groups.

**Significance Level:**
(\alpha = 0.05)

---

## **4. Statistical Test**

A **Welch’s t-test** was conducted due to unequal sample sizes and potential variance differences.

* **Test statistic:**
  [
  t(29.11) = 0.655
  ]

* **p-value:**
  [
  p = 0.5174
  ]

* **Mean difference (US – UK):**
  [
  2.47
  ]

* **95% Confidence Interval:**
  [
  [-5.25,\ 10.19]
  ]

### **Interpretation**

Since *p* > 0.05, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**.
There is **no statistically significant difference** in mean Overall Score between US and UK universities.

---

## **5. Effect Size**

* **Cohen’s d = 0.18**

### **Interpretation**

Cohen’s d of 0.18 indicates a **negligible practical significance** of any observed difference.
Even though the US mean is slightly higher, the effect is too small to be meaningful.

---

## **6. Final Conclusion**

Although the US universities have a slightly higher average score (71.10 vs 68.63), this difference is **not statistically significant** (*p* = 0.5174) and the effect size is **negligible** (d = 0.18).
Overall, the data provides **no evidence of a meaningful performance gap** between US and UK universities.
